## Project Background

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

With more than **43 quintillion unique combinations**, a scrambled Rubik's Cube seems impossible to solve. Yet with a simple guide, anyone can learn how to solve it. My first solve attempt took 30 minutes, and within a week, it was down to 5 minutes. 

What's even more impressive are "speedcubers" who can solve a scrambled cube in less than 10 seconds! Techniques such as the [Beginner's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_by_Layer), [CFOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFOP_method), or even [Roux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing#Roux_method) work by memorizing many combinations of turns (known as algorithms) and when to use them.

However, we're not here to learn how to solve a Rubik's cube - we want a machine to learn how to solve it. Can we harness the power of machine learning to solve a Rubik's Cube?
